-- We need to build guard towers around the village.
-- Each peasant can build one tower.
-- Show them the place to build.
-- These towers are automatic and will attack ALL units outside the town.

-- First move along the north border (y=60) from x=40 to x=80 with the step 20.
for x = 40, 80, 20 do
    -- Move at each point and say anything.
    hero:moveXY(x, 60)
    hero:say("Here")
end
-- Next move along the east border (x=80) from y=40 to y=20 with the negative step -20.
for y = 40, 20, -20 do
    hero:moveXY(80, y)
    hero:say("Here")
end
-- Continue for the two remaining borders.
-- Next the south border (y=20) from x=60 to x=20 with the negative step -20.
for x = 60, 20, -20 do
    -- Move at each point and say anything.
    hero:moveXY(x, 20)
    hero:say("Here")
end
-- Next the west border (x=20) from y=40 to y=60 with the step 20.
for y = 40, 60, 20 do
    hero:moveXY(20, y)
    hero:say("Here")
end
-- Don't forget hide inside the village.
hero:moveXY(50, 40)
